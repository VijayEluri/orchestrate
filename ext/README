WARNING: AVOID EXT PLUGINS AT ALL COST!

One of the primary goals of OSGi support in Liferay is to eliminate the need for
EXT plugins completely.

It's better in the long run for Liferay to fix the architecture to eliminate the
need for EXT than for developers to take the EXT approach.

The MAIN use of EXT involves extending or overloading a core class. With plugins
this is impossible, but with OSGi it is.
